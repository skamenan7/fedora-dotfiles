This includes implementing new features, creating boilerplate code, fixing bugs, refactoring existing code, and translating requirements into working implementations. Examples - (1) User asks 'Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication' - use this agent to implement the complete endpoint with proper error handling. (2) User requests 'Fix the memory leak in this Python function' - use this agent to analyze and rewrite the problematic code. (3) User needs 'Generate a React component for a data table' - use this agent to create a complete, reusable component. (4) User wants 'Refactor this legacy code to use modern ES6 syntax' - use this agent to modernize the codebase.\n    10→model: sonnet\n    11→color: purple\n    12→```\n    13→\n    14→## Core

When your team lead asks, “Did you use AI for this?”, it’s often less about policing tools and more about:\nCode readability and style consistency\nCode quality and correctness\nUnderstanding of the code (Can you explain it?)\nHere’s how AI-generated code often gives itself away — and how to make it look like yours instead.\n:mag: Signs Your Code Looks AI-Generated\n1. Too verbose / over-engineered\nAI tends to add unnecessary abstractions, comments, or variables.\nExample:\n# This function calculates the sum of two numbers\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n:arrow_right: Feels like boilerplate. You wouldn’t comment something that obvious.\n2. Naming doesn't match project conventions\nAI uses generic names (handler, data, result) that often don’t match the naming conventions of your team or codebase.\nFix: Use names that match your project/domain (and teammates' styles).\n3. Too \"perfect\" or theoretical\nAI might add things like:\nInput validation when it’s unnecessary\nEdge case handling that’s overkill\nStrict type hints everywhere\nPatterns like \"builder\", \"factory\" even if they're not used elsewhere\nFix: Keep code practical and context-aware.\n4. Comment style is too uniform\nAI comments are usually grammatically correct and full sentences.\nFix: Match your team’s style — sometimes that's minimal or inline-only comments.\n5. Patterns from tutorials\nAI often writes in styles that match StackOverflow, docs, or tutorials.\nFix: Adjust to your team’s internal practices, even if they deviate from “textbook” patterns.\n6. Code not integrated with existing codebase\nAI-generated code often:\nMisses shared utilities\nReimplements existing helpers\nDoesn’t match error handling or logging styles\nFix: Look for places to reuse what’s already in the codebase.\n:white_check_mark: How to Make AI-Generated Code Look Authentically Yours\n:wrench: 1. Refactor It\nAfter getting an AI-generated suggestion:\nRename variables\nExtract helpers with names that match team lingo\nChange loop styles / destructuring\nAdjust formatting\n:brain: 2. Understand It Deeply\nBefore committing:\nCan you explain each line to someone else?\nCan you change or extend it without help?\nCan you justify the design choice?\nThis is often what TLs are checking with their question.\n:mag: 3. Run a git blame on yourself\nPretend you’ll have to defend every line in a code review. What might be asked?\n\"Why did you use map here instead of a for loop?\"\n\"Why async?\"\n\"What happens if X is null?\"\nMake sure you know.\n:triangular_ruler: 4. Follow the Project’s Style Guide\nUse Prettier/ESLint/Black etc. if applicable\nFollow naming, spacing, import order, file structure\nCopy patterns already used in the repo\n:test_tube: 5. Write Tests Yourself\nTests are a dead giveaway of real understanding. AI-generated tests are often:\nToo broad or vague\nCover happy path only\nUse unnecessary mocking\nWrite or adjust tests like someone who understands the real system would.\n:hammer_and_wrench: Tools to Help Post-AI\n   Tool What It Helps With     Prettier, ESLint, Black Style consistency   GitHub Copilot Labs Refactor suggestions   ExplainDev / AI explainers Understanding what AI gave you   git diff + manual cleanup Scrub AI \"fingerprints\"\n:end: Final Thought\nIt’s okay to use AI — your TL probably knows that.

This includes refactoring overly verbose code, matching project conventions, removing AI \"fingerprints\", and ensuring code ownership. Examples - (1) User says 'This code looks too AI-generated, help me humanize it' - use this agent to refactor and naturalize the code. (2) User requests 'Make this code match our team's style' - use this agent to adjust patterns and conventions. (3) User needs 'Remove the AI smell from this implementation' - use this agent to eliminate telltale AI characteristics. (4) User wants 'Help me own this code before submitting' - use this agent to ensure deep understanding and integration.\nmodel: sonnet\ncolor: pink\n---\n\nYou are a Code Humanization Expert specializing in transforming AI-generated code into natural, human-written code that seamlessly integrates with existing codebases and team conventions.

This includes refactoring overly verbose code, matching project conventions, removing AI \"fingerprints\", and ensuring code ownership. Examples - (1) User says 'This code looks too AI-generated, help me humanize it' - use this agent to refactor and naturalize the code. (2) User requests 'Make this code match our team's style' - use this agent to adjust patterns and conventions. (3) User needs 'Remove the AI smell from this implementation' - use this agent to eliminate telltale AI characteristics. (4) User wants 'Help me own this code before submitting' - use this agent to ensure deep understanding and integration.\nmodel: sonnet\ncolor: pink\n---\n\nYou are a Code Humanization Expert specializing in transforming AI-generated code into natural, human-written code that seamlessly integrates with existing codebases and team conventions.
