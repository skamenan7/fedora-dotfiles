Most of the time, there are many links to _other_ Google docs in any given document.\n\nI often need to open many such links at a time. Say you want to open 6 links (which is typical), you have to either:\n\n**Using Mouse**\n\n1\\. Click the Doc link\n\n2\\. Wait for the \"preview\" to appear\n\n3\\. Click the _actual_ link in the preview\n\n4\\. Navigate _back_ to the original doc, because the link took focus in the browser.\n\n^ repeat for every link you need to open\n\n**Using Hotkeys**\n\n1\\. Position your cursor over the link you want\n\n2\\. Hit \"Option+Enter\"\n\n3\\. Navigate _back_ to the original doc, because the link took focus in the browser.\n\n^ repeat for every link you need to open\n\nIs there _any way_ to streamline this? On Google search, you can Command+click or Ctrl+click dozens of links to open them in background tabs. It's easy. Is there an easy way to do this in Google docs? Why is there so much friction?\n\nDetails\n\n[Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28category%3Adocs_docs%29), [Mac OS](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28detail%3Adocs_platform%3Adocs_mac%29), [Business](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28detail%3Adocs_package%3Adocs_business%29)\n\nLocked\n\nInformational notification.\n\nThis question is locked and replying has been disabled.\n\nI have the same question (26)\n\nSubscribe\n\nCommunity content may not be verified or up-to-date.

These apps can provide shareable links. Shareable links can be used for publishing a document or for collaboratively editing a document.\n\n![Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drawgings](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502978604818-H0L2QNSMH9TUAGIJB9RS/image-asset.png)\n\nDocuments are only accessible by you (the owner) unless you **turn link sharing on**. One way to turn on link sharing is by clicking the _Share_ button in an open document. Then you'll see an option to _Get shareable link_. Clicking that option turns link sharing on and copies the link to your clipboard. The link is set to _Anyone with the link can_ **_view_** _._ You can change this to _Anyone with the link can_ **_comment_** or **_edit._**\n\n![Get Shareable LInk](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502978919523-F0YTEON9CTEDYWJFLVTS/image-asset.png)\n\nOnce you have the shareable link copied, you can paste it into a document, webpage, link shortener, Twitter, Facebook, etc. By replacing _/edit_ in the URL, you can do some pretty nifty tricks. You can transform a shareable link into a **Preview**, **Copy**, **Template**, or **PDF** link.\n\nBelow are glanceable graphics for each kind of link.

A Preview link declutters the web page, which emphases your content over the tool you used to create it. In fact, your audience may not know you created the document in Google Workspace.\n\nPreview links are good for newsletters, flyers, and instructional materials. It's also great for when you want to present a Google Slides presentation full screen. A preview link shows slides in presentation view, and it keeps your browser tabs visible (making it easy to switch between the presentation and other webpages).\n\nExample: [Classy Graphics Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sVZYYazblxw5lhO8ZlblHSe42y0ZhJpb1kTK-vYT9eM/preview)\n\n- Previewed documents load faster and work much better in mobile browsers than the standard shareable version. This is particularly true with Google Drawings, which does not have a mobile app.\n\n- Comments and anything that is off the slide or canvas is not displayed in a previewed document. Furthermore, a Slides presentation does not have the slide sorter—the presentation is shown in Presentation view.\n\n- The audience for a Preview link does not see editing in real-time. However, a recent version of the document is shown each time the page is loaded. There’s no need to republish or reshare the document to update the Preview version. Note that the preview might take several minutes to update.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /preview. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- Changing _/edit_ to _/preview?rm=minimal_ in Google Slides presents the slideshow without the navigation bar at the bottom. This is handy when you do not want your audience to skip slides. (Thanks to Shaun Creighton in the comments for this tip!)\n\n- Since a Preview link removes menus, viewers of your document will not have the ability to choose File → Make a Copy to add a copy to their own Google Drive. However, if you encounter a Preview version of a document and wish to make a copy, try this: Replace /preview with /edit in the URL. You’ll then see the version with menus and you can then access the File menu to make a copy.\n\n- A Preview link for a Google Doc does not show the document outline (the list of headings on the left side). But, you can modify the URL to be a Preview link _and_ show the document outline. Simple replace /edit with /preview?rm=demo. Thanks to [Wanda Terral](https://ignitionedu.com/2024/06/google-doc-demo-mode) for this tip.\n\n- Adding a Preview URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Preview version. If you want to add a Preview link, first paste the Preview link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Preview version. Alternatively, you could paste the Preview link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\n\nView fullsize\n\n![Preview Link graphic by Tony Vincent](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729591884-8CYC53HWZHD6LORALIW9/Preview.png)\n\n![Make a Copy Icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502982823815-SMLPS8IQZAMUVXG3S0K4/image-asset.png)\n\n## Make a Copy Link\n\n**_Force others to make a copy before viewing your document_**\n\n→ Replace _/edit_ with _/copy_\n\nYou’ve probably clicked a link to a Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, or Drawings file and had to click a Make a Copy button before proceeding. This method of sharing forces a user to make a copy of the original, and the copy is now fully owned by the user and placed in her Google Drive.\n\nMake a Copy links are good for when you have created a document in Google Workspace and want students to have their very own copy. Students can fill in blanks, finish a slideshow, label a drawing, annotate text, or complete some task in their own document (and then possibly share it back with the teacher). Sharing this way is also useful for sharing templates with other teachers. They can simply click to make their own copy and customize it without affecting your original.\n\nExample: [Notes of Encouragement (for printing on 1.5 x 2 inch sticky notes)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qf_TVpBxkVgBdp-X22x99u8_WYM3x8axrzX1Hi1ewbM/copy?usp=sharing)\n\n- Google Classroom automates this process when teachers post assignments that include a Google document. Classroom gives the option to make a copy for each student.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- Comments will not be copied over when you change /edit to /copy. If you want to include comments, see _Make a Copy with Comments Link_ below **.**\n\n- When students and teachers make a copy, they have full ownership of the copy and the original document owner is no longer associated with the copy. If the first document owner makes changes to the original document, those changes be reflected in future copies, but will not change copies already made of the document.\n\n\nView fullsize\n\n![Make a Copy LInk Graphic by Tony Vincent](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729627244-8KB2EA181CKVCBCSUGHD/Make+a+Copy.png)\n\n![Copy with Comments Icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1523975766724-6PTJ7TBUAY02YRTFED1E/Copy+with+Comments.png)\n\n## Make a Copy with Comments Link\n\n**_Force others to make a copy that includes comments from the original before viewing your document_**\n\n→ Replace _/edit_ with _/copy?copyComments=true_\n\nThis link works just like the regular _Make a Copy_ link, but it also copies any comments from the original document into the copy. This can be handy if there are comments you want viewers to see and possibly reply to. Comments may include additional information, instructions, checklists, and hyperlinks.\n\nExample: [Lines of Symmetry by Eric Curts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ox23HzI4g0C0aJgi6ITLwpWD46Rd5ofvkWH2DJLzCA/copy?copyComments=true)\n\n- Comments that are copied from the original document include the notice, \"Comments above copied from original document.\"\n\n- For more information about this kind of link, read Eric Curt's post [How to Force a Docs Copy WITH Pre-Loaded Comments to Help your Students.](http://www.controlaltachieve.com/2017/11/force-copy-comments.html)\n\n- If you highlight text or select an image before clicking the Comment button, the comment will be associated with that selection.\n\n- Adding a Make a Copy with Comments URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Copy with Comments version. If you want to add a Copy with Comments link, first paste the link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Make a Copy with Comments version. Alternatively, you could paste the Make a Copy with Comments link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\n\n![Make a Copy with Comments](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729650175-X21L5WIV33MBLF0K25NS/Make+a+Copy+with+Comments.png)\n\n![Template Icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502982857432-LWHNLOR2IIULLV4N0T0A/image-asset.png)\n\n## Template Link\n\n**_Share an easy-to-copy preview of your document_**\n\n→ Replace _/edit_ with _/template/preview_\n\nUse a Template link to share the contents of your document with the option to make a copy—it's a combination of a Preview link and a Make a Copy link.\n\nA Template link presents a clutter-free version of your document. It also displays a _Use Template_ button. Clicking this button makes a copy of the original document, and the copy is now fully owned by the user and placed in her Google Drive.\n\nTemplate links are good for allowing others to see the document before copying to Google Drive. These kinds of links are usually preferred over Make a Copy links when posting on websites and social media since they allow the document to be seen before blindly being copied.\n\nExample: [Magnetic Poetry](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VceC_EgHOvzJ-mxMCJW1e7d9ipEFB3qF9sAvuoGTJJg/template/preview)\n\n- Unlike clicking the _Make a Copy_ button, clicking _Use Template_ does not put \"Copy of\" in the newly copied document's file name.\n\n- The audience for a Template link does not see editing in real-time. However, a recent version of the document is shown each time the page is loaded. There’s no need to republish or reshare the document to update the Template version. Note that the document's preview might take several minutes to update.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- iPhones and iPads are a little quirky when it comes to Template links. After clicking _Use Template_, the freshly copied document does not automatically open in the Documents, Sheets, or Slides app. However, when the app is opened, the new document is there. Sorting by _Last modified_ can make finding the document easier.\n\n- Adding a Template URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Template version. If you want to add a Template link, first paste the Template link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Template version. Alternatively, you could paste the Template link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\n\nView fullsize\n\n![Template Link Graphic by Tony Vincent](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729687412-OBC4I1CFXPCS6BCFU2QU/Template.png)\n\n![PDF icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502982880518-UUSE0BQBGTWVY9FST2C9/image-asset.png)\n\n## PDF Link\n\n**_Share a direct download of a PDF version of your document_**\n\n→ Google Docs & Sheets: Replace _/edit_ with _/export?format=pdf_\n\n→ Google Slides & Drawings: Replace _/edit_ with _/export/pdf_\n\nHave the web browser download a PDF version of your document with a PDF link. Instead of displaying the document in Google's viewer or app, a PDF is automatically downloaded when the link is clicked.\n\nPDF links are good for when you want others to print or save your document. They are handy for sharing posters, infographics and cheat sheets.\n\nExample: [Google Classroom Post Options](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1fvtnOG9iJRjtyKHxKeD2alssU635mhGHYqwzYITszys/export/pdf)\n\n- Since a PDF is a universal format, a Google account is not required to download and not necessary to open the file.\n\n- PDF files may open in any number of apps: Adobe Reader, Preview, Google Drive, Foxit Reader, Explain Everything, etc.\n\n- Automatic downloads do not appear in the browser window on computers. It is easy for someone to miss that a file was downloaded when clicked. Be sure to label your PDF link so that others know that a file will be downloaded.\n\n- Downloads go to different places, depending on the browser, computer, and settings. The recipient might be prompted to rename the file and choose a location. Or, a downloaded file might automatically be placed in a Downloads folder or on the desktop.\n\n- Hyperlinks do work in PDFs. Any text, images, or shapes that you have hyperlinked in your document will remain linked in the PDF version.\n\n- Direct downloads are not limited to PDF. Other file types also work. Instead of using _pdf_ in URL, try _png, jpg, pptx, xlsx, docx, html,_ or _txt_.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy.

If you set the Share setting so that anyone is a Viewer, even if they reverse the /preview link to /edit, they cannot actually edit the document.\n\nInstead of sharing so that anyone with the link is a Viewer, you could Share with specific emails (paste your student and parent email addresses) and make them Viewers (not Editors). You don't need to notify them. Then when you include the link in the body of a Google Classroom post, they will see the Preview version and can click links.

Both open the presentation so that it takes up the entire browser tab.\n\nChanging to /preview requires that you have shared the document so that anyone with the link can view. It's possible for someone to change the /preview to /edit and then make a copy of the slides. The toolbar is always showing along the bottom of the window.\n\nPublishing to the web shares the presentation in a way that doesn't allow copying. Publishing to the web gives you embed code for putting onto webpages. Publishing also gives you the option to auto-advance the slides and loop the presentation. The toolbar floats near the bottom and disappears after a few seconds.\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n[![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)](https://www.buildsometech.com/2018/12/google-drive-direct-download-link.html)\n\n[Aashish Yadav](https://www.buildsometech.com/2018/12/google-drive-direct-download-link.html) 5 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nHi Tony,\n\nAwesome Post!

However, the way I share my Google documents (usually through a Make a Copy document), there is not a way for me to see how many copies have been made. I sometimes use a URL shortener and get stats from that, but that does not capture all the copies of the document since teachers usually pass a document along without using the shortener.\n\nBeing an educator is awesome!

Then I File → Make a copy, which gives me the option to put the copy into one of my folders.\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)\n\nZoltan6 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nThanks, great article!!!\n\nDo you know how to make a copy link that works on mobile?\n\nZoltan\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v2/namespaces/memberAccountAvatars/libraries/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12db/25dedc04d3c341d4929edc1b27b15aec/25dedc04d3c341d4929edc1b27b15aec.jpeg?format=300w?&format=100w)\n\nTony Vincent6 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nThe same trick of changing /edit to /copy also works on mobile devices. 👍\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)\n\nJoachim Mund6 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nThanks, great article!\n\n/present seems to be a link for opening a google presentation in presentation mode.\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)\n\n6 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nTony,\n\nOur onsite programmer would like to know if there is any official documentation from Google on all the \"hacks\" possible like mentioned in this post.

I've been using the preview option for about a year now and it works great for my membership. What I have not been able to figure out is how to combine the Template option with the Make a Copy With Comments option. Some of my Templates have comments and I want my members to be able to read the comments when they use the Preview Template option and copy (Use Template) from the Preview. No matter what I try I can't get the comments to copy over. Is there a certain way to configure the url for this or is it just not possible?

If you want to add a Preview link, first paste the Preview link into URL shortener like Bitly. Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Preview version. Alternatively, you could paste the Preview link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n[![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)](http://www.ls.se/)\n\n[Christian Modigh](http://www.ls.se/) 8 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nCreating, posting and viewing Preview-links in classroom now seem to work.

Most of the time, there are many links to _other_ Google docs in any given document.\n\nI often need to open many such links at a time. Say you want to open 6 links (which is typical), you have to either:\n\n**Using Mouse**\n\n1\\. Click the Doc link\n\n2\\. Wait for the \"preview\" to appear\n\n3\\. Click the _actual_ link in the preview\n\n4\\. Navigate _back_ to the original doc, because the link took focus in the browser.\n\n^ repeat for every link you need to open\n\n**Using Hotkeys**\n\n1\\. Position your cursor over the link you want\n\n2\\. Hit \"Option+Enter\"\n\n3\\. Navigate _back_ to the original doc, because the link took focus in the browser.\n\n^ repeat for every link you need to open\n\nIs there _any way_ to streamline this? On Google search, you can Command+click or Ctrl+click dozens of links to open them in background tabs. It's easy. Is there an easy way to do this in Google docs? Why is there so much friction?\n\nDetails\n\n[Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28category%3Adocs_docs%29), [Mac OS](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28detail%3Adocs_platform%3Adocs_mac%29), [Business](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=%28detail%3Adocs_package%3Adocs_business%29)\n\nLocked\n\nInformational notification.\n\nThis question is locked and replying has been disabled.\n\nI have the same question (26)\n\nSubscribe\n\nCommunity content may not be verified or up-to-date.

These apps can provide shareable links. Shareable links can be used for publishing a document or for collaboratively editing a document.\n\n![Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drawgings](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502978604818-H0L2QNSMH9TUAGIJB9RS/image-asset.png)\n\nDocuments are only accessible by you (the owner) unless you **turn link sharing on**. One way to turn on link sharing is by clicking the _Share_ button in an open document. Then you'll see an option to _Get shareable link_. Clicking that option turns link sharing on and copies the link to your clipboard. The link is set to _Anyone with the link can_ **_view_** _._ You can change this to _Anyone with the link can_ **_comment_** or **_edit._**\n\n![Get Shareable LInk](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502978919523-F0YTEON9CTEDYWJFLVTS/image-asset.png)\n\nOnce you have the shareable link copied, you can paste it into a document, webpage, link shortener, Twitter, Facebook, etc. By replacing _/edit_ in the URL, you can do some pretty nifty tricks. You can transform a shareable link into a **Preview**, **Copy**, **Template**, or **PDF** link.\n\nBelow are glanceable graphics for each kind of link.

A Preview link declutters the web page, which emphases your content over the tool you used to create it. In fact, your audience may not know you created the document in Google Workspace.\n\nPreview links are good for newsletters, flyers, and instructional materials. It's also great for when you want to present a Google Slides presentation full screen. A preview link shows slides in presentation view, and it keeps your browser tabs visible (making it easy to switch between the presentation and other webpages).\n\nExample: [Classy Graphics Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sVZYYazblxw5lhO8ZlblHSe42y0ZhJpb1kTK-vYT9eM/preview)\n\n- Previewed documents load faster and work much better in mobile browsers than the standard shareable version. This is particularly true with Google Drawings, which does not have a mobile app.\n\n- Comments and anything that is off the slide or canvas is not displayed in a previewed document. Furthermore, a Slides presentation does not have the slide sorter—the presentation is shown in Presentation view.\n\n- The audience for a Preview link does not see editing in real-time. However, a recent version of the document is shown each time the page is loaded. There’s no need to republish or reshare the document to update the Preview version. Note that the preview might take several minutes to update.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /preview. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- Changing _/edit_ to _/preview?rm=minimal_ in Google Slides presents the slideshow without the navigation bar at the bottom. This is handy when you do not want your audience to skip slides. (Thanks to Shaun Creighton in the comments for this tip!)\n\n- Since a Preview link removes menus, viewers of your document will not have the ability to choose File → Make a Copy to add a copy to their own Google Drive. However, if you encounter a Preview version of a document and wish to make a copy, try this: Replace /preview with /edit in the URL. You’ll then see the version with menus and you can then access the File menu to make a copy.\n\n- A Preview link for a Google Doc does not show the document outline (the list of headings on the left side). But, you can modify the URL to be a Preview link _and_ show the document outline. Simple replace /edit with /preview?rm=demo. Thanks to [Wanda Terral](https://ignitionedu.com/2024/06/google-doc-demo-mode) for this tip.\n\n- Adding a Preview URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Preview version. If you want to add a Preview link, first paste the Preview link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Preview version.

This method of sharing forces a user to make a copy of the original, and the copy is now fully owned by the user and placed in her Google Drive.\n\nMake a Copy links are good for when you have created a document in Google Workspace and want students to have their very own copy. Students can fill in blanks, finish a slideshow, label a drawing, annotate text, or complete some task in their own document (and then possibly share it back with the teacher). Sharing this way is also useful for sharing templates with other teachers. They can simply click to make their own copy and customize it without affecting your original.\n\nExample: [Notes of Encouragement (for printing on 1.5 x 2 inch sticky notes)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qf_TVpBxkVgBdp-X22x99u8_WYM3x8axrzX1Hi1ewbM/copy?usp=sharing)\n\n- Google Classroom automates this process when teachers post assignments that include a Google document. Classroom gives the option to make a copy for each student.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- Comments will not be copied over when you change /edit to /copy. If you want to include comments, see _Make a Copy with Comments Link_ below **.**\n\n- When students and teachers make a copy, they have full ownership of the copy and the original document owner is no longer associated with the copy. If the first document owner makes changes to the original document, those changes be reflected in future copies, but will not change copies already made of the document.\n\n\nView fullsize\n\n![Make a Copy LInk Graphic by Tony Vincent](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729627244-8KB2EA181CKVCBCSUGHD/Make+a+Copy.png)\n\n![Copy with Comments Icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1523975766724-6PTJ7TBUAY02YRTFED1E/Copy+with+Comments.png)\n\n## Make a Copy with Comments Link\n\n**_Force others to make a copy that includes comments from the original before viewing your document_**\n\n→ Replace _/edit_ with _/copy?copyComments=true_\n\nThis link works just like the regular _Make a Copy_ link, but it also copies any comments from the original document into the copy. This can be handy if there are comments you want viewers to see and possibly reply to. Comments may include additional information, instructions, checklists, and hyperlinks.\n\nExample: [Lines of Symmetry by Eric Curts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ox23HzI4g0C0aJgi6ITLwpWD46Rd5ofvkWH2DJLzCA/copy?copyComments=true)\n\n- Comments that are copied from the original document include the notice, \"Comments above copied from original document.\"\n\n- For more information about this kind of link, read Eric Curt's post [How to Force a Docs Copy WITH Pre-Loaded Comments to Help your Students.](http://www.controlaltachieve.com/2017/11/force-copy-comments.html)\n\n- If you highlight text or select an image before clicking the Comment button, the comment will be associated with that selection.\n\n- Adding a Make a Copy with Comments URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Copy with Comments version. If you want to add a Copy with Comments link, first paste the link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Make a Copy with Comments version. Alternatively, you could paste the Make a Copy with Comments link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\n\n![Make a Copy with Comments](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729650175-X21L5WIV33MBLF0K25NS/Make+a+Copy+with+Comments.png)\n\n![Template Icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502982857432-LWHNLOR2IIULLV4N0T0A/image-asset.png)\n\n## Template Link\n\n**_Share an easy-to-copy preview of your document_**\n\n→ Replace _/edit_ with _/template/preview_\n\nUse a Template link to share the contents of your document with the option to make a copy—it's a combination of a Preview link and a Make a Copy link.\n\nA Template link presents a clutter-free version of your document. It also displays a _Use Template_ button. Clicking this button makes a copy of the original document, and the copy is now fully owned by the user and placed in her Google Drive.\n\nTemplate links are good for allowing others to see the document before copying to Google Drive. These kinds of links are usually preferred over Make a Copy links when posting on websites and social media since they allow the document to be seen before blindly being copied.\n\nExample: [Magnetic Poetry](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VceC_EgHOvzJ-mxMCJW1e7d9ipEFB3qF9sAvuoGTJJg/template/preview)\n\n- Unlike clicking the _Make a Copy_ button, clicking _Use Template_ does not put \"Copy of\" in the newly copied document's file name.\n\n- The audience for a Template link does not see editing in real-time. However, a recent version of the document is shown each time the page is loaded. There’s no need to republish or reshare the document to update the Template version. Note that the document's preview might take several minutes to update.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- iPhones and iPads are a little quirky when it comes to Template links. After clicking _Use Template_, the freshly copied document does not automatically open in the Documents, Sheets, or Slides app. However, when the app is opened, the new document is there. Sorting by _Last modified_ can make finding the document easier.\n\n- Adding a Template URL for a document to a Google Classroom post ends up reverting to the original version, not the Template version. If you want to add a Template link, first paste the Template link into URL shortener like [Bitly](http://bitly.com/). Copy the new link Bitly provides. Adding the shortened link to a post in Google Classroom will end up opening the Template version. Alternatively, you could paste the Template link into the body of the post (instead of using the link button to add the link).\n\n\nView fullsize\n\n![Template Link Graphic by Tony Vincent](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1561729687412-OBC4I1CFXPCS6BCFU2QU/Template.png)\n\n![PDF icon](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50eca855e4b0939ae8bb12d9/1502982880518-UUSE0BQBGTWVY9FST2C9/image-asset.png)\n\n## PDF Link\n\n**_Share a direct download of a PDF version of your document_**\n\n→ Google Docs & Sheets: Replace _/edit_ with _/export?format=pdf_\n\n→ Google Slides & Drawings: Replace _/edit_ with _/export/pdf_\n\nHave the web browser download a PDF version of your document with a PDF link. Instead of displaying the document in Google's viewer or app, a PDF is automatically downloaded when the link is clicked.\n\nPDF links are good for when you want others to print or save your document. They are handy for sharing posters, infographics and cheat sheets.\n\nExample: [Google Classroom Post Options](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1fvtnOG9iJRjtyKHxKeD2alssU635mhGHYqwzYITszys/export/pdf)\n\n- Since a PDF is a universal format, a Google account is not required to download and not necessary to open the file.\n\n- PDF files may open in any number of apps: Adobe Reader, Preview, Google Drive, Foxit Reader, Explain Everything, etc.\n\n- Automatic downloads do not appear in the browser window on computers. It is easy for someone to miss that a file was downloaded when clicked. Be sure to label your PDF link so that others know that a file will be downloaded.\n\n- Downloads go to different places, depending on the browser, computer, and settings. The recipient might be prompted to rename the file and choose a location. Or, a downloaded file might automatically be placed in a Downloads folder or on the desktop.\n\n- Hyperlinks do work in PDFs. Any text, images, or shapes that you have hyperlinked in your document will remain linked in the PDF version.\n\n- Direct downloads are not limited to PDF. Other file types also work. Instead of using _pdf_ in URL, try _png, jpg, pptx, xlsx, docx, html,_ or _txt_.\n\n- Your shareable link from Google documents might have some additional characters after /edit. Don’t worry about them. Simply replace /edit with /copy. You can either keep or delete what was after /edit and your link should work just fine.\n\n- If you'd like the PDF to display in the browser, you can use Google's online document viewer. Add _https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=_ to the beginning of the PDF link.

If you set the Share setting so that anyone is a Viewer, even if they reverse the /preview link to /edit, they cannot actually edit the document.\n\nInstead of sharing so that anyone with the link is a Viewer, you could Share with specific emails (paste your student and parent email addresses) and make them Viewers (not Editors). You don't need to notify them. Then when you include the link in the body of a Google Classroom post, they will see the Preview version and can click links.

Both open the presentation so that it takes up the entire browser tab.\n\nChanging to /preview requires that you have shared the document so that anyone with the link can view. It's possible for someone to change the /preview to /edit and then make a copy of the slides. The toolbar is always showing along the bottom of the window.\n\nPublishing to the web shares the presentation in a way that doesn't allow copying. Publishing to the web gives you embed code for putting onto webpages. Publishing also gives you the option to auto-advance the slides and loop the presentation. The toolbar floats near the bottom and disappears after a few seconds.\n\nPreview\nPost Reply\n\n\n[![](https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/images-v6/default-avatar.png)](https://www.buildsometech.com/2018/12/google-drive-direct-download-link.html)\n\n[Aashish Yadav](https://www.buildsometech.com/2018/12/google-drive-direct-download-link.html) 5 years agoPendingAwaiting Moderation\n\nHi Tony,\n\nAwesome Post!

I sometimes use a URL shortener and get stats from that, but that does not capture all the copies of the document since teachers usually pass a document along without using the shortener.\n\nBeing an educator is awesome! I recommend taking up any chances you get to work with students of a variety of ages.
