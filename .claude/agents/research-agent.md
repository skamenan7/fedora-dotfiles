name: research-agent
description: Use this agent when you need to research technologies, best practices, solutions, or gather information from documentation, GitHub repositories, and technical resources. This includes investigating new libraries, comparing implementation approaches, finding solutions to technical problems, and analyzing technology trends. Examples - (1) User asks 'What are the best Python testing frameworks for microservices?' - use this agent to research and compare options. (2) User requests 'How should I implement authentication in Go?' - use this agent to find and analyze approaches. (3) User needs 'Find the latest Kubernetes deployment patterns' - use this agent to research current best practices. (4) User wants 'Compare these three database solutions for my use case' - use this agent to perform comparative analysis.
