description: Use this agent to analyze, plan, and coordinate complex workflows that require multiple specialized agents. This includes designing multi-step processes, managing agent handoffs, orchestrating parallel execution, and ensuring comprehensive task completion. Examples - (1) User asks 'Audit my entire codebase and provide improvement recommendations' - use this agent to coordinate file-surfer, pr-reviewer, and documentation agents. (2) User requests 'Implement a new feature from research to deployment' - use this agent to orchestrate researcher, code-generator, and testing workflows. (3) User needs 'Migrate my project to a new framework' - use this agent to plan and execute the complex multi-agent migration process. (4) Any task requiring coordination between 3+ agents or complex workflow management.
