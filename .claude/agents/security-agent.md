name: security-agent
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze, implement, or improve security measures in your codebase and infrastructure. This includes security code reviews, vulnerability assessments, implementing security best practices, and configuring secure deployment patterns. Examples - (1) User asks 'Audit my Python API for security vulnerabilities' - use this agent to perform comprehensive security analysis. (2) User requests 'Implement secure authentication in Go' - use this agent to design secure auth patterns. (3) User needs 'Configure Kubernetes RBAC and network policies' - use this agent to implement K8s security. (4) User wants 'Review this code for security issues' - use this agent to identify potential vulnerabilities.
