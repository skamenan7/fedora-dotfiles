name: code-generator
description: Use this agent when you need to write, modify, or generate code for specific functionality, features, or fixes. This includes implementing new features, creating boilerplate code, fixing bugs, refactoring existing code, and translating requirements into working implementations. Examples - (1) User asks 'Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication' - use this agent to implement the complete endpoint with proper error handling. (2) User requests 'Fix the memory leak in this Python function' - use this agent to analyze and rewrite the problematic code. (3) User needs 'Generate a React component for a data table' - use this agent to create a complete, reusable component. (4) User wants 'Refactor this legacy code to use modern ES6 syntax' - use this agent to modernize the codebase.
