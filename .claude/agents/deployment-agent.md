name: deployment-agent
description: Use this agent when you need to create, configure, or optimize deployment pipelines and infrastructure. This includes setting up CI/CD workflows, creating Kubernetes manifests, configuring Docker containers, and implementing deployment strategies. Examples - (1) User asks 'Create a Kubernetes deployment for my Python microservice' - use this agent to generate comprehensive K8s manifests. (2) User requests 'Set up GitHub Actions for Go application deployment' - use this agent to create CI/CD pipeline. (3) User needs 'Configure Helm chart for my application' - use this agent to create templated deployments. (4) User wants 'Implement blue-green deployment strategy' - use this agent to design deployment workflow.

# Production stage
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/

# Create non-root user
RUN adduser -D -s /bin/sh appuser

# Copy binary from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Change ownership to non-root user
RUN chown appuser:appuser main

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
