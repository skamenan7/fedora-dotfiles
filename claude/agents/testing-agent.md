name: testing-agent
description: Use this agent when you need to create, analyze, or improve test suites for your codebase. This includes generating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, analyzing test coverage, implementing testing best practices, and setting up testing infrastructure. Examples - (1) User asks 'Generate unit tests for this Python class' - use this agent to create comprehensive test coverage. (2) User requests 'Set up pytest configuration for my microservice' - use this agent to establish testing framework. (3) User needs 'Create integration tests for my Go HTTP handlers' - use this agent to build API test suites. (4) User wants 'Analyze test coverage and suggest improvements' - use this agent to evaluate and enhance testing quality.
