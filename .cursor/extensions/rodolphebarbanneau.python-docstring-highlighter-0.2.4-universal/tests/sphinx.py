"""Example module with Sphinx style docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the
`Sphinx Python Style Guide`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines.
Sections are created with a section header and a colon followed by a block of
indented text.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks are also
implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

The :attr:`module_level_variable1` module level variables must be documented
in an inline docstring immediately following the variable.

See Also:
    `Extension Documentation`_ for more details on the extension.

.. todo::
    * For TODOs directive module
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension

    used to specify the type of the parameter being documented. Alternatively,
    this can be specified in the ``:param:`` directive just before the
    parameter name. The name of each parameter is required. The type and
    description of each parameter is optional, but should be included if not
    obvious.
